# Sampling design

The sampling techniques available to you can be divided into two types:

-   probability or representative sampling;
-   non-probability or judgmental sampling.

With probability samples the chance, or probability, of each case being selected from the population is known and is usually equal for all cases. This means that it is possible to answer research questions and to achieve objectives that require you to estimate statistically the characteristics of the population from the sample. Consequently, probability sampling is often associated with survey and experimental research strategies.

For non-probability samples, the probability of each case being selected from the total population is not known and it is impossible to answer research questions or to address objectives that require you to make statistical inferences about the characteristics of the population. You may still be able to generalise from non-probability samples about the population, but not on statistical grounds.

## Probability sampling

Probability sampling (or representative sampling) is most commonly associated with survey-based research strategies where you need to make inferences from your sample about a population to answer your research question(s) or to meet your objectives. The process of probability sampling can be divided into four stages:

-   Identify a suitable sampling frame based on your research question(s) or objectives.
-   Decide on a suitable sample size.
-   Select the most appropriate sampling technique and select the sample.
-   Check that the sample is representative of the population.

### The sampling frame

The sampling frame for any probability sample is a complete list of all the cases in the population from which your sample will be drawn. If your research question or objective is concerned with members of a local golf club, your sampling frame will be the complete membership list for that golf club. If your research question or objective is concerned with registered childminders in a local area, your sampling frame will be the directory of all registered childminders in this area. In setting sample frame, the following questions should be answered:

-   How recently was the sampling frame compiled, in particular is it up to date?
-   Does the sampling frame include all cases, in other words is it complete?
-   Does the sampling frame contain the correct information, in other words is it accurate?
-   Does the sampling frame exclude irrelevant cases, in other words is it precise?
-   (For purchased lists) Can you establish and control precisely how the sample will be selected?

### Deciding on a suitable sample size

Generalisations about populations from data collected using any probability sample are based on statistical probability. The larger your sample's size the lower the likely error in generalising to the population. Probability sampling is therefore a compromise between the accuracy of your findings and the amount of time and money you invest in collecting, checking and analysing the data. Your choice of sample size within this compromise is governed by:

-   the confidence you need to have in your data -- that is, the level of certainty that the characteristics of the data collected will represent the characteristics of the total population;
-   the margin of error that you can tolerate - that is, the accuracy you require for any esti- mates made from your sample;
-   the types of analyses you are going to undertake; and to a lesser extent:
-   the size of the total population from which your sample is being drawn.

Statisticians have proved that the larger the absolute size of a sample, the more closely its distribution will be to the normal distribution and thus the more robust it will be. This relationship, known as the central limit theorem, occurs even if the population from which the sample is drawn is not normally distributed. Statisticians have also shown that a sample size of 30 or more will usually result in a sampling distribution for the mean that is very close to a normal distribution.

It is likely that, if you are undertaking statistical analyses on your sample, you will be drawing conclusions from these analyses about the population from which your sample was selected. This process of coming up with conclusions about a population on the basis of data describing the sample is called statistical inference and allows you to calculate how probable it is that your result, given your sample size, could have been obtained by chance. Such probabilities are usually calculated automatically by statistical analysis software. However, it is worth remembering that, providing they are not biased, samples of larger absolute size are more likely to be representative of the population from which they are drawn than smaller samples and, in particular, the mean (average) calculated for the sample is more likely to equal the mean for the population. This is known as the law of large numbers.

Researchers normally work to a 95 per cent level of certainty. This means that if your sample was selected 100 times, at least 95 of these samples would be certain to represent the characteristics of the population. The confidence level states the precision of your estimates of the population as the percentage that is within a certain range or margin of error.

![Sample sizes for different sizes of population at a 95 percent confidence level (assuming the data are collected from all cases in the sample)](images/SCR-20221122-lge.png){#fig-samp_error}

The above table provides a rough guide to the different minimum sample sizes required from different sizes of population given a 95 per cent confidence level for different margins of error. It assumes that data are collected from all cases in the sample. For most business and management research, researchers are content to estimate the population's characteristics at 95 per cent certainty to within plus or minus 3 to 5 per cent of its true values. This means that if 45 per cent of your sample are in a certain category then you will be 95 per cent certain that your estimate for the total population within the same category will be 45 per cent plus or minus the margin of error -- somewhere between 42 and 48 per cent for a 3 per cent margin of error.

As you can see from the above, the smaller the absolute size of the sample and, to a far lesser extent, the smaller the relative proportion of the total population sampled, the greater the margin of error. Within this, the impact of absolute sample size on the margin of error decreases for larger sample sizes. Some argue that it is for this reason that many market research companies limit their samples' sizes to approximately 2000. Unfortunately, from many samples, a 100 per cent response rate is unlikely and so your sample will need to be larger to ensure sufficient responses for the margin of error you require.

### Selecting the most appropriate sampling techniques and the sample

Having chosen a suitable sampling frame and established the actual sample size required, you need to select the most appropriate sampling technique to obtain a representative sample. Five main techniques can be used to select a probability sample: - simple random; - systematic; - stratified random; - cluster; - multi-stage.

Your choice of probability sampling technique depends on your research question(s) and your objectives.

![Selecting a probability sample)](images/SCR-20221122-lgu.png){#fig-prob_samp_tech}

#### Simple random sampling

Simple random sampling (sometimes called just random sampling) involves you selecting the sample at random from the sampling frame using either random number tables.

It is usual to select your first random number at random (closing your eyes and pointing with your finger is one way!) as this ensures that the set of random numbers obtained for different samples is unlikely to be the same. If you do not, you will obtain sets of numbers that are random but identical.

#### Systematic sampling

Systematic sampling involves you selecting the sample at regular intervals from the sampling frame. To do this you:

-   Number each of the cases in your sampling frame with a unique number. The first case is numbered 0, the second 1 and so on.
-   Select the first case using a random number.
-   Calculate the sampling fraction.
-   Select subsequent cases systematically using the sampling fraction to determine the frequency of selection.

#### Stratified random sampling

Stratified random sampling is a modification of random sampling in which you divide the population into two or more relevant and significant strata based on one or a number of attributes. In effect, your sampling frame is divided into a number of subsets. A ran- dom sample (simple or systematic) is then drawn from each of the strata. Consequently, stratified sampling shares many of the advantages and disadvantages of simple random or systematic sampling. Dividing the population into a series of relevant strata means that the sample is more likely to be representative, as you can ensure that each of the strata is represented proportionally within your sample. However, it is only possible to do this if you are aware of, and can easily distinguish, significant strata in your sampling frame. In addition, the extra stage in the sampling procedure means that it is likely to take longer, to be more expensive, and to be more difficult to explain than simple random or systematic sampling.

In some instances, your sampling frame will already be divided into strata. A sampling frame of employee names that is in alphabetical order will automatically ensure that, if systematic sampling is used (discussed earlier), employees will be sampled in the correct proportion to the letter with which their name begins. Similarly, membership lists that are ordered by date of joining will automatically result in stratification by length of membership if systematic sampling is used.

#### Cluster sample

Cluster sampling is, on the surface, similar to stratified sampling as you need to divide the population into discrete groups prior to sampling (Henry 1990). The groups are termed clusters in this form of sampling and can be based on any naturally occurring grouping. For example, you could group your data by type of manufacturing firm or geographical area.

For cluster sampling your sampling frame is the complete list of clusters rather than a complete list of individual cases within the population. You then select a few clusters, normally using simple random sampling. Data are then collected from every case within the selected clusters. The technique has three main stages:

-   choose the cluster grouping for your sampling frame.
-   Number each of the clusters with a unique number. The first cluster is numbered 0, the second 1 and so on.
-   Select your sample using some form of random sampling as discussed earlier.

Selecting clusters randomly makes cluster sampling a probability sampling technique.

#### Multi-stage sampling

Multi-stage sampling, sometimes called multi-stage cluster sampling, is a development of cluster sampling. It is normally used to overcome problems associated with a geographically dispersed population when face-to-face contact is needed or where it is expensive and time consuming to construct a sampling frame for a large geographical area. However, like cluster sampling, you can use it for any discrete groups, including those that are not geographically based. The technique involves taking a series of cluster samples, each involving some form of random sampling.

### Checking that the sample is representative

Often it is possible to compare data you collect from your sample with data from another source for the population. For example, you can compare data on the age and socio-economic characteristics of respondents in a marketing survey with these characteristics for the population in that country as recorded by the latest national census of population. If there is no statistically significant difference, then the sample is representative with respect to these characteristics.

## Non-probability sampling

The techniques for selecting samples discussed earlier have all been based on the assumption that your sample will be chosen statistically at random. Consequently, it is possible to specify the probability that any case will be included in the sample. However, within business research, such as market surveys and case study research, this may either not be possible (as you do not have a sampling frame) or appropriate to answering your research question. This means your sample must be selected some other way. Non- probability sampling (or non-random sampling) provides a range of alternative techniques to select samples based on your subjective judgement. In the exploratory stages of some research projects, such as a pilot survey, a non-probability sample may be the most practical, although it will not allow the extent of the problem to be determined. Subsequent to this, probability sampling techniques may be used. For other business and management research projects your research question(s), objectives and choice of research strategy may dictate non-probability sampling.

### Deciding on a suitatble sample size

For all non-probability sampling techniques, other than for quota samples the issue of sample size is ambiguous and, unlike probability sampling, there are no rules. Rather the logical relationship between your sample selection technique and the purpose and focus of your research is important, generalisations being made to theory rather than about a population. Consequently, your sample size is dependent on your research question(s) and objectives - in particular, what you need to find out, what will be useful, what will have credibility and what can be done within your available resources.

### Selecting the most appropriate sampling technique and the sample

Having decided the likely suitable sample size, you need to select the most appropriate sampling technique to enable you to answer your research question from the range of non-probability sampling techniques available.

#### Quota sampling

Quota sampling is entirely non-random and is normally used for interview surveys. It is based on the premise that your sample will represent the population as the variability in your sample for various quota variables is the same as that in the population. Quota sampling is therefore a type of stratified sample in which selection of cases within strata is entirely non-random (Barnett 1991). To select a quota sample you:

-   Divide the population into specific groups.
-   Calculate a quota for each group based on relevant and available data.
-   Give each interviewer an 'assignment', which states the number of cases in each quota from which they must collect data.
-   Combine the data collected by interviewers to provide the full sample.

Quota sampling has a number of advantages over the probabilistic techniques. In particular, it is less costly and can be set up very quickly. If, as with television audience research surveys, your data collection needs to be undertaken very quickly then quota sampling may be the only possibility. In addition, it does not require a sampling frame and, therefore, may be the only technique you can use if one is not available.

Quota sampling is normally used for large populations. For small populations, it is usually possible to obtain a sampling frame. Decisions on sample size are governed by the need to have sufficient responses in each quota to enable subsequent statistical analy- ses to be undertaken. This often necessitates a sample size of between 2000 and 5000.

#### Purposive sampling

Purposive or judgemental sampling enables you to use your judgement to select cases that will best enable you to answer your research question(s) and to meet your objectives. This form of sample is often used when working with very small samples such as in case study research and when you wish to select cases that are particularly informative.

#### Snowball sampling

Snowball sampling is commonly used when it is difficult to identify members of the desired population, for example people who are working while claiming unemployment benefit. You, therefore, need to:

-   Make contact with one or two cases in the population.
-   Ask these cases to identify further cases.
-   Ask these new cases to identify further new cases (and so on).
-   Stop when either no new cases are given or the sample is as large as is manageable.

The main problem is making initial contact. Once you have done this, these cases identify further members of the population, who then identify further members, and so the sample snowballs.

#### Self-selection sampling

Self-selection sampling occurs when you allow each case, usually individuals, to identify their desire to take part in the research. You therefore:

-   Publicise your need for cases, either by advertising through appropriate media or by asking them to take part.
-   Collect data from those who respond.

Publicity for convenience samples can take many forms. These include articles and advertisements in magazines that the population are likely to read, postings on appropriate Internet newsgroups and discussion groups, hyperlinks from other websites as well as letters or emails of invitation to colleagues and friends (Box 7.14). Cases that self-select often do so because of their feelings or opinions about the research question(s) or stated objectives.

#### Convenience sampling

Convenience sampling (or haphazard sampling) involves selecting haphazardly those cases that are easiest to obtain for your sample, such as the person interviewed at random in a shopping centre for a television programme or the book about entrepreneurship you find at the airport. The sample selection process is continued until your required sample size has been reached.
