{"title":"What is research","markdown":{"headingText":"What is research","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nWhen listening to the radio, watching the television or reading a daily newspaper it is difficult to avoid the term 'research'. The results of 'research' are all around us. A debate about the findings of a recent poll of people's opinions inevitably includes a discussion of 'research', normally referring to the way in which the data were collected. Politicians often justify their policy decisions on the basis of 'research'. Newspapers report the findings of research companies' surveys. Documentary programs tell us about 'research findings', and advertisers may highlight the 'results of research' to encourage you to buy a particular product or brand. However, we believe that what these examples really emphasizes is the wide range of meanings given to the term 'research' in everyday speech.\n\n@walliman_your_2005 argues that many of these everyday uses of the term 'research' are not research in the true meaning of the word. As part of this, he highlights ways in which the term is used wrongly:\n\n-   just collecting facts or information with no clear purpose;\n-   reassembling and reordering facts or information without interpretation;\n-   as a term to get your product or idea noticed and respected.\n\nThe first of these highlights the fact that, although research often involves the collection of information, it is more than just reading a few books or articles, talking to a few people or asking people questions. While collecting data may be part of the research process, if it is not undertaken in a systematic way, on its own and, in particular, with a clear purpose, it will not be seen as research. The second of these is commonplace in many reports. Data are collected, perhaps from a variety of different sources, and then assembled in a single document with the sources of these data listed. However, there is no interpretation of the data collected. Again, while the assembly of data from a variety of sources may be part of the process of research, without interpretation it is not research. Finally, the term 'research' can be used to get an idea or product noticed by people and to suggest that people should have confidence in it. In such instances, when you ask for details of the research process, these are either unclear or not forthcoming. [See @saunders_research_2019]\n\nIn short, research is a diligent search, studious inquiry or investigation or experimentation aimed at the discovery of new facts and findings; or broadly, it may relate to any subject of inquiry with regard to collection of information, interpretation of facts, revision of existing theories or laws in the light of new facts or practical ideas. [See @adams_research_2014]\n\nBased upon this brief discussion we can already see that research has a number of characteristics:\n\n-   Data are collected systematically.\n-   Data are interpreted systematically.\n-   There is a clear purpose: to find things out.\n\nWe can therefore define research as something that people undertake in order to find out things in a systematic way, thereby increasing their knowledge. Two phrases are important in this definition: 'systematic way' and 'to find out things'. 'Systematic' suggests that research is based on logical relationships and not just beliefs (@ghauri_research_2002). As part of this, your research will involve an explanation of the methods used to collect the data, will argue why the results obtained are meaningful, and will explain any limitations that are associated with them. 'To find out things' suggests there are a multiplicity of possible purposes for your research. These may include describing, explaining, understanding, criticizing and analyzing (@ghauri_research_2002). However, it also suggests that you have a clear purpose or set of 'things' that you want to find out, such as the answer to a question or number of questions [See @saunders_research_2019].\n\n## Research method vs. research methodology\n\nA research method is a way of conducting and implementing research. The term 'methods' refers to specific activities (e.g. designing questionnaire, conducting interviews, focus groups, observation etc.). On the other hand, research methodology is the science and philosophy behind all research. It is more about our attitude to and our understanding of research and the strategy or approach you choose to answer research questions.\n\n## Why is research conducted\n\nResearch is conducted for a number of reasons, which in turn depend on the objectives of any particular 'research problem'. It may be to find out something we do not already know or to enhance our understanding of phenomena that we already know something about. In the business arena, however, research tends to be undertaken in order to achieve one or more of the following objectives [@adams_research_2014]:\n\n-   To gain a competitive advantage\n-   To test new products and services\n-   To solve a management/organisational problem\n-   To provide information, which may help to avoid future business problems\n-   To forecast future sales\n-   To better understand shifts in consumer attitudes and tastes\n-   To enhance profitability\n-   To reduce operational costs\n-   To enable the management to priorities strategic options for the future etc.\n\n## Approaches to business and social research\n\nResearchers usually handle numerous problems and apply research methods to obtain the best guess answers to their questions. They may use a single study or a combination of two designs. The investigator has to decide about the types and combinations of research forms that best serve the goals of the study. Broadly speaking, there are two main domains of research frequently observed in the literature, which are Quantitative research and Qualitative research. It is possible to combine quantitative and qualitative together to answer a single research question. Those approaches are known as mixed method research works. The diverse practices and uses of today's research practices are listed in the following paragraphs.\n\n-   Quantitative research\n-   Qualitative research\n-   Pure theoretical research\n-   Applied research\n-   Longitudinal studies\n-   Theory vs. empirical study\n\n## The research process\n\n![The Research process (@saunders_research_2019)](images/SCR-20221004-gg4.png){#fig-res_process}\n\n## The hallmarks of scientific research\n\nThe hallmarks or main distinguishing characteristics of scientific research may be listed as follows (@bougie_research_2020):\n\n-   Purposiveness\n-   Rigor\n-   Testability\n-   Replicability\n-   Precision and confidence\n-   Objectivity\n-   Generalizability\n-   Parsimony\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"chapter_1.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
