It may be to find out something we do not already know or to enhance our understanding of phenomena that we already know something about. In the business arena, however, research tends to be undertaken in order to achieve one or more of the following objectives (Adams, Khan, and Raeside 2014):\n\nTo gain a competitive advantage\nTo test new products and services\nTo solve a management/organisational problem\nTo provide information, which may help to avoid future business problems\nTo forecast future sales\nTo better understand shifts in consumer attitudes and tastes\nTo enhance profitability\nTo reduce operational costs\nTo enable the management to priorities strategic options for the future etc.",

    "text": "1.3 Approaches to business and social research\nResearchers usually handle numerous problems and apply research methods to obtain the best guess answers to their questions. They may use a single study or a combination of two designs. The investigator has to decide about the types and combinations of research forms that best serve the goals of the study. Broadly speaking, there are two main domains of research frequently observed in the literature, which are Quantitative research and Qualitative research. It is possible to combine quantitative and qualitative together to answer a single research question. Those approaches are known as mixed method research works. The diverse practices and uses of today’s research practices are listed in the following paragraphs.\n\nQuantitative research\nQualitative research\nPure theoretical research\nApplied research\nLongitudinal studies\nTheory vs. empirical study",

    "text": "3.2 Central limit theorem\nAccording to the Central Limit Theorem the sampling distribution of the sample mean is approximately normal for large samples. For a \\(95\\%\\) confidence level it follows that,\n\\[\n\\mathbb{P} \\left(\\bar{x}-1.96 \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} &lt; \\mu &lt; \\bar{x}+1.96\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right)\n\\]\nThe interval \\(\\bar{x} \\pm 1.96\\sigma_{\\bar{x}}\\) is called the large sample \\(95\\%\\) confidence interval for the population mean \\(\\mu\\). The term large sample refers to the sample being of sufficiently large size that we can apply the Central Limit Theory and the normal \\(z\\) statistic to determine the form of the sampling distribution of \\(\\bar{x}\\). Empirical research suggests that a sample size \\(n\\) exceeding a value between 20 and 30 will usually yield a sampling distribution of \\(\\bar{x}\\), that is normal.\nIf the sample means (e.g. \\(\\bar{x}_1, \\bar{x}_3\\) and \\(\\bar{x}_4\\)) falls between the two lines on either side of \\(\\mu\\), then the interval \\(\\bar{x} \\pm 1.96\\sigma_{\\bar{x}}\\) will contain \\(\\mu\\); if \\(\\bar{x}\\) falls outside the boundaries (e.g. \\(\\bar{x}_2\\)), the interval \\(\\bar{x} \\pm 1.96\\sigma_{\\bar{x}}\\) will not contain \\(\\mu\\).\\ From the Empirical rule, we know that, the area under the normal curve (the sampling distribution of \\(\\bar{x}\\) between these boundaries is exactly 0.95. Thus the probability that a randomly selected interval \\(\\bar{x} \\pm 1.96\\sigma_{\\bar{x}}\\), will contain \\(\\mu\\) is equal to \\(0.95\\) or \\(95\\%\\).\\ Large sample interval estimator requires knowing the value of the population \\(\\sigma\\). In most practical applications, the value of population \\(\\sigma\\) is unknown. For large samples, in the absence of \\(\\sigma\\), sample standard deviation \\(s\\) provides a good approximation to \\(\\sigma\\).",
