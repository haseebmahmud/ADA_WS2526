We suggest that Postcolonial Studies may offer richer frameworks for analysis than taxonomic models of culture such as Hofstede’s dimensions of difference. A postcolonial perspective sees culture as dynamic and always changing, stressing the importance of colonial histories, uneven economic relations, and local knowledge systems in framing and designing information technologies.",

Applying postcolonial feminist methodological assumptions from a location of racial privilege is not without its problems. Data illustrate the researcher’s (un)easiness in facing evidence of personal adherence to Eurocentric power and privilege despite having a desire to be an instrument of social change. This retrospective critical reflection of fieldwork indicates that novice postcolonial feminist researchers need to embrace the destabilizing but inescapable journey of cultural alterity to avoid “finalizing,” as Arthur Frank puts it, marginalized identities into new forms of colonialist representations. This article reminds qualitative health and nursing researchers that race, gender, and class create multiple tensions and contradictions making the field inherently gendered, political, personal, and public.",
