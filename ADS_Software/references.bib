	abstract = {Understanding intercultural collaboration is a thorny problem in CSCW and organizational studies that grows every more important as globalization generates increasing intercultural interactions between individuals, groups, and technologies. We suggest that Postcolonial Studies may offer richer frameworks for analysis than taxonomic models of culture such as Hofstede’s dimensions of difference. A postcolonial perspective sees culture as dynamic and always changing, stressing the importance of colonial histories, uneven economic relations, and local knowledge systems in framing and designing information technologies.},

	abstract = {Drawing on participant observation and interview excerpts collected during a critical ethnography, this article
discusses the dilemmas of applying postcolonial feminist assumptions in fieldwork. Applying postcolonial
feminist methodological assumptions from a location of racial privilege is not without its problems. Data
illustrate the researcher’s (un)easiness in facing evidence of personal adherence to Eurocentric power and
privilege despite having a desire to be an instrument of social change. This retrospective critical reflection
of fieldwork indicates that novice postcolonial feminist researchers need to embrace the destabilizing but
inescapable journey of cultural alterity to avoid ‘finalizing,’ as Arthur Frank puts it, marginalized identities
into new forms of colonialist representations. This article reminds qualitative health and nursing researchers
that race, gender, and class create multiple tensions and contradictions making the field inherently gendered,
political, personal, and public.},
